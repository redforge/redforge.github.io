				<h1> Skills &amp; Specialties </h1>
				<div class="underrow"> </div>
				<div class="par">
					As a multilingual programmer, I'm able to adapt to almost any development environment in any major language.
				</div>
				<div class="par">
					<h3>Here are just a few of the languages I'm experienced in:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><h4>Python</h4> - As a web backend, a data processing tool,
							a controller for an autonomous robot, and a backend for user-facing applications. </li>

						<li><h4>Java</h4> - For data processing, machine learning, and game development</li>

						<li><h4>C</h4> - For data processing and basic machine learning.</li>

						<li><h4>RobotC</h4> - As a controller for a simple autonomous robot.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="par">
					<h3>And, for web development:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><h4>JavaScript</h4> - I use JavaScript for dynamic control of CSS and HTML for frontends,
						preprocessing for backend and bandwidth optimization,
						realtime data transmission between client and server systems, and HTML canvas based browser games.
						I have also made web apps entirely in JavaScript, removing the need for a backend altogether when suitable.</li>

						<li><h4>CSS</h4> - I use CSS for basic styling, responsive styling (both with and without JavaScript),
							substituting simple images in UI elements with more lightweight and adaptable CSS replacements.
							I typically create interfaces using CSS variables and other modern web technologies,
							but always make sure to retain functionality even on legacy systems. </li>

						<li><h4>HTML</h4> - As with anything on the web, HTML is the basis of every web app, web game, and web site I've ever made.
						I always make sure to do whatever can be reasonably done using only HTML and CSS,
						and integrating my JavaScript as closely with the DOM as possible.</li>
					</ul>
