				<h1> My Philosophy </h1>

				<h4>
					<strong>&ldquo;The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows.&rdquo;</strong>
					<span style="display: inline-block;"> - <em> Sydney J. Harris, Journalist and Writer </em> </span>
				</h4>
				<div class="par">
					Today's world is full of complex devices and systems have become integral to almost all of our lives,
					yet few people actually understand how they work. My goal, as an educator and a leader, is to change this &mdash;
					to make the inner workings of everyday technologies transparent to my students, no matter how young.
				</div>
				<div class="par">
					I've always believed that the best way to learn is by doing, and this is something I have taken to heart throughout my time as an educator.
					No matter what I'm teaching, I make sure my students (and my peers) practice the subject being taught, so that they can truly understand it.
